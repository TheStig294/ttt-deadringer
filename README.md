# ttt-deadringer

A watch that feigns your death when you take damage. You will be cloaked for a short time and your attacker will be fooled.

## Features

This is a modified version of the [TTT Dead Ringer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=810154456) addon because it has not been updated to fix issues with TTT2 compatibility.

This equipment is available for the Traitors and Detectives in the Equipment menu.

Includes an individual shop icon.
