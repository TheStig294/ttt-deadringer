# CHANGELOG

Inspired from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [v1.1.0]
### Added
- Added new setting `ttt_deadringer_corpse_role`
    - Determines if a player's real role or a fake innocent role will be shown on the corpse
- Added new setting `ttt_deadringer_corpse_confirm`
    - Determines if the fake corpse will confirm the player's role when checked
    - This may be used in tandem with `ttt_deadringer_corpse_role` to confirm fake/real roles

## [v1.0.1]
### Fixed
- Fixed misleading text for the `ttt_deadringer_damage_reduction_time` setting to mention that the value is in absolute seconds and not a percentage.

## [v1.0.0]
### Fixed
- Fixed addon settings not being set correctly for TTT2 (#1)
